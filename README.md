## 📌 Projects

### 1. ✅ Simple Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

- 📂 Folder: `house_price_prediction_with_simple_linear_regression`
- 🔍 Predict house price using **only one feature** (area in sqft).
- 📈 Uses `LinearRegression()` with one independent variable.
- 💡 Good starting point to understand how ML models work.

### 2. ✅ Multiple Linear Regression – House Price Prediction

- 📂 Folder: `house_price_prediction_with_multiple_linear_regression`
- 🔍 Predict house price using **multiple features** like:
  - Area (sqft)
  - Location score
  - Number of bedrooms
- 📈 Uses `LinearRegression()` with multiple independent variables.
- 💼 Closer to real-world prediction problems.

### 3. ✅ Plynomial Regression – House Price Prediction

- 📂 Folder: `house_price_prediction_with_Polynomial_Rgression`
- 🔍 Predict house price using **multiple features** like:
  - Area (sqft)
  - Location score
  - Number of bedrooms
- 📈 Uses `LinearRegression(); PolynomialFeatures(); ColumnTransformer(); StandardScaler()` with multiple independent variables.
- 💼 Closer to real-world prediction problems.
